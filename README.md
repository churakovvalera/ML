## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, and other relevant attributes. The project is divided into several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, analysis, model building, evaluation, and optimization.

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Housing Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It contains information about various houses and their sale prices.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical features into numerical features using techniques like One-Hot Encoding
- Scaling numerical features using StandardScaler

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves visualizing the data to understand its distribution and relationships between features. Techniques used include:
- Histograms and density plots for distribution analysis
- Correlation matrix and heatmaps for relationship analysis

## Model Building

Several machine learning models are built and evaluated, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2). The performance of each model is compared to identify the best performing one.

## Model Optimization

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the models. Cross-validation is used to ensure the stability of the models.

## Results Visualization

The results of the models, including feature importances and predictions, are visualized using bar plots, scatter plots, and other relevant visualizations.

## Conclusion

The project concludes with a summary of findings, including the most important features influencing housing prices and the performance of the different models. Recommendations for improving the models and potential applications of the results are discussed.

## Future Work

Potential future work includes:
- Experimenting with other machine learning algorithms
- Incorporating additional data sources
- Improving data preprocessing techniques
